# What is a Software Post-Mortem and How Do You Write One?

## What is a post-mortem?

Why did we start a post-mortem / Why are we even talking about a post-mortem? The need to use a post-mortem typically occurs when a release went "bad" (not as good as the team would have wanted).

A post-mortem is where a team reflects on what went wrong with something they did, and documents it or amends their process to stop it from happening again.

Post-mortems ARE NOT to assign blame on people but to find process failures

We want to learn every single lesson we can from the outages and emergencies to ensure they never happen again. Nothing is more valuable than experience.

## Dos & Donts

- Don't blame people, teams, organisations or users but focus on processes.
- Don't overestimate the predictability of past events (Hindsight bias)
- Dig deep to the bottom of the error and ask yourself what process could have avoided it
- Analyse the resolution process and make them actionable
- Focus on what can be done in the short term so we can avoid the error to happen again ASAP
- Let your post-mortem challenge what your team currently believes to be true. Don't assume because everyone believes something to be true that it is (Common belief fallacy) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)
- Use a post-mortem template

## What are the key points of a post-mortem template?

Put headings of the template as bullet points.

## An example: the career survey on `forms` post-mortem
